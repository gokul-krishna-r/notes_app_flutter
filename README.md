# note_app_flutter

A Flutter Notes App Using SQLite Database.
This is one of my sample projects. 

## About the App

The app lets you creat notes and edit them. It's a really simple app.
The app uses flutter widget such as :

- FutureBuilder
- ListView
- Form
- FAB
- TextFormField
- TextField
- RaisedButton
- FlatButton
- _and more_..
 
 This is now just a bare bone app. I intend to include more features such as :
 
 - Firebase integration
 - Canvas
 - Change Note Color
 - Rearrange Note
